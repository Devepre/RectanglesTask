## Features

- [x] First tap and second tap can set the beginning and end of the object (rectangle). First tap should display small circle of first tap. First tap circle should disappear after drawing object (rectangle)

- [x] Minimal size of object (rectangle) should be 100x100 pixels
- [x] user can select the object (move object on top over others)
- [x] user can change object color with long tap gesture (just apply new random color)
- [x] user can drag/move object
- [x] user can rotate object (using two fingers gesture)
- [ ] user can resize object in 3-axis direction: width only (horizontal), height only (vertical), diagonal (width and height together)
- [x] user can remove object via 2 taps on object
- [ ] Second way to resize each object


## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 9.0+

## Installation
### Manually

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level projects directory, and run the following command:

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/Devepre/RectanglesTask.git
  ```

- Open the new `RectanglesTask` folder
- Open the `Rectangles Fun.xcodeproj` file using Xcode.
- Next, if you want to launch on a real device (what is a preffered way), choose the `Rectangles Fun` in the Project Navigator and verify the code signing section. Probably you should also change `Bundle Identifier` to your own in order to keep signing colisions running out.
- Choose your device or simulator and click Run!
- Wait until App is loading and start your fun with it.
